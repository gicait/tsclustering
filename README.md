# Recent Expansions in Cashewut and Mango Plantations in Cambodia - Mapping from the Space

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing plantation expansion in Cambodia, specifically in the provinces of Kampong Thom and Oddar Meanchey, using remote sensing data from Landsat-8 imagery. Over the past decade, both provinces have experienced significant growth in cashew nut and mango plantations, driven by government policies, infrastructure investments, and increasing global demand. The study utilizes NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series data from 2013 to 2024 to monitor vegetation changes and detect shifts in land use. Two clustering algorithms, K-means and VQ-VAE, are implemented in this project to identify temporal patterns in plantation growth. The analysis provides valuable insights into the timing, extent, and dynamics of plantation expansion.
